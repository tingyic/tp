### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called
[`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) 
and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). 
It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues 
the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class 
* (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality 
using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given 
component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled 
to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`,
`ModuleListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` 
class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files
that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the
[`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) 
is specified in
[`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Module` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `ModuleTrackerParser` class to parse the user command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is
executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a module).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` 
API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` 
should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `ModuleTrackerParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a 
placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse
the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `ModuleTrackerParser` returns back
as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` 
interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** :
[`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the module tracker data i.e., all `Module` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueModuleList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Module` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list 
which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Module>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be 
bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as 
a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, 
they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) 
model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `ModuleTracker`, which `Module` references. This allows `ModuleTracker` to
only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Module` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : 
[`Storage.java`](https://tinyurl.com/3dmsfunt)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both module tracker data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding 
objects.
* inherits from both `ModuleTrackerStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only 
the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects
that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.moduletracker.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Find feature

#### Find Command Implementation
This section will explain the implementation of the FindCommand and the FindCommandParser. The FindCommand allows users
to search for modules whose names or types contain any of the specified keywords (case-insensitive).

FindCommand Class
The FindCommand class is responsible for finding and listing all modules in the module tracker whose name contains any of
the argument keywords. Keyword matching is case insensitive.
The FindCommandParser is responsible for parsing the input given by the user.

The FindCommand utilizes the FilteredList from JavaFx and uses a predicate to initialize a FindCommand object. This
predicate is programmed such that it will match for the name of the module and type of the module.

The predicate passed to the FindCommand constructor is from the class NameContainsKeywordsPredicate. This class has a
test method which is used by the FilteredList.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the find command behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `ModuleTracker` will be initialized with the initial
module tracker state.

Step 2. The user executes `find CS3263` command. The 'find CS3263' will be handled by the LogicManager and 
ModuleTrackerParser which will extract out the needed argument, more importantly the predicate.

Step 3. Now, the command is executed through the execute method which will update the list through
`Model#updateFilteredModuleList`

Step 4. The method set the predicate to the filtered list which will run the `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate#test()` to
find the items based on name or type

<!-- ### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedModuleTracker`. It extends `ModuleTracker` with an 
undo/redo history, stored internally as an `moduleTrackerStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it 
implements the following operations:

* `VersionedModuleTracker#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current module tracker state in its history.
* `VersionedModuleTracker#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous module tracker state from its history.
* `VersionedModuleTracker#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone module tracker state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitModuleTracker()`, `Model#undoModuleTracker()` 
and `Model#redoModuleTracker()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedModuleTracker` will be initialized with the 
initial module tracker state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single module tracker state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th module in the module tracker. The `delete` command calls 
`Model#commitModuleTracker()`, causing the modified state of the module tracker after the `delete 5` command executes to be
saved in the `moduleTrackerStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted module tracker state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new module. The `add` command also calls 
`Model#commitModuleTracker()`, causing another modified module tracker state to be saved into the `moduleTrackerStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will
not call `Model#commitModuleTracker()`, so the module tracker state will not be saved into the `moduleTrackerStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the module was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the
`undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoModuleTracker()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once
to the left, pointing it to the previous module tracker state, and restores the module tracker to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0,
pointing to the initial ModuleTracker state, then there are no previous ModuleTracker states to restore. The `undo` command
uses `Model#canUndoModuleTracker()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end
at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoModuleTracker()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer`
once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the module tracker to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index
`ModuleTrackerStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest module tracker state, then there are no undone ModuleTracker
states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoModuleTracker()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will
return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the module tracker, such as
`list`, will usually not call `Model#commitModuleTracker()`, `Model#undoModuleTracker()` or `Model#redoModuleTracker()`.
Thus, the `moduleTrackerStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitModuleTracker()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not
pointing at the end of the `moduleTrackerStateList`, all module tracker states after the `currentStatePointer` will be 
purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern
desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" /> -->

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire module tracker.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the module being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.
